# SWGOLO
We use a parametrization of muon and electron+gamma fluxes as a function of radius R for energetic air showers, and a simplified description of detector units in terms of efficiency and acceptance, to model the measurement  of gamma rays by the SWGO array and to optimize the utility function of the experiment as a function of detector positions
